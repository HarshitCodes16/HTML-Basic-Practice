    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m a second-year Computer Engineering student at Thapar University with a passion for technology and problem-solving. I love exploring new innovations in the tech world, whether itâ€™s coding, software development, or just geeking out over the latest trends. Beyond academics, Iâ€™m a social and friendly person who enjoys spending quality time with friends. Youâ€™ll often find me playing table tennis or badminton, unwinding over a good conversation, or just enjoying the little moments that make life exciting. I believe in continuous learning and pushing my limits to grow both as an engineer and as an individual. ðŸš€</p>
